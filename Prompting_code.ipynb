The learning and test phases of NOP trials occurred in either the same context or in different contexts. When the learning and test contexts were the same, rats with HPC lesions performed like control rats, displaying a significant tendency to investigate a novel object more than a familiar sample object. When the test occurred in a context that was familiar but different from the learning context, performance was unaffected in control rats, but rats with HPC lesions no longer discriminated between the objects, and therefore showed no evidence of recognizing the sample object. When the test context was unfamiliar, novel-object preference in control rats was attenuated but still above chance levels, whereas rats with HPC lesions did not show a preference. The data suggest that the HPC is not critical for encoding or retrieving conjunctive representations of the context in which incidental learning occurs, whereas it plays an essential role in recognition of objects that are subsequently encountered in different contexts.\",\n          \"Neuregulin 1 (Nrg1) has been implicated in the development of schizophrenia and influences key neurodevelopmental processes such as myelination and neuronal migration. The heterozygous transmembrane domain Nrg1 mutant mouse (Nrg1 TM HET) exhibits a sex-specific phenotype relevant for schizophrenia research, which is characterized by the development of locomotor hyperactivity, social withdrawal, and changes to the serotonergic system. Cognitive impairments are characteristic of schizophrenia patients and male Nrg1 TM HET mice exhibit cognitive deficits in novel object recognition and contextual fear conditioning. Thus, we investigated the cognitive performance of female Nrg1 mutants, using a cognitive test battery for a variety of paradigms, including fear conditioning, cheeseboard, Y maze, object exploration and passive avoidance. Female Nrg1 mutant mice displayed impairments in the fear conditioning tasks, including significantly reduced fear conditioning to a context and a strong trend towards a decreased ability for cue fear conditioning. These cognitive deficits were task-specific, as no differences were seen between mutant and control mice in spatial learning of the cheeseboard for reference memory measures, in the Y-maze for working memory measures, or in novel object recognition and passive avoidance paradigms. These findings indicate that neuregulin 1 plays only a minor role in cognition in female test mice. The current study provides a further behavioural validation of this genetic mouse model for the schizophrenia candidate gene neuregulin 1 and confirms the importance of considering female test animals in animal models for schizophrenia.\",\n          \"Animals need to optimize the efficacy of memory retrieval to adapt to environmental circumstances for survival. The recent development of memory engram labeling technology allows a precise investigation of the processes associated with the recall of a specific memory. Here, we show that engram cell excitability is transiently increased following memory reactivation. This short-term increase of engram excitability enhances the subsequent retrieval of specific memory content in response to cues and is manifest in the animal's ability to recognize contexts more precisely and more effectively. These results reveal a hitherto unknown transient enhancement of context recognition based on the plasticity of engram cell excitability. They also suggest that recall of a contextual memory is influenced by previous but recent activation of the same engram. The state of excitability of engram cells mediates differential behavioral outcomes upon memory retrieval and may be crucial for survival by promoting adaptive behavior.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label_included\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["abstract = df['abstract'].tolist()\n"],"metadata":{"id":"lhTeCEzXNCrW"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(abstracts)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"78tRc1OJiZE6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740246964249,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"DANIELA AGOSTINA GONZALEZ","userId":"09716119056927086354"}},"outputId":"e0b13301-cbf8-4da6-fea7-d4f0a481d461"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["236"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":7}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Creating a list for saving the results\n","list_key_model = list()"],"metadata":{"id":"KJryD12RQlSC"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["for i in range(len(abstracts)):\n","    prompt = f\"\"\"\n","    Your task is to select papers that are relevant (1) or irrelevant (0), based on the abstracts, to make a systematic review on the field of behavioral neuroscience and cognitive psychology, focusing on context-dependent memory in rodents, particularly studied through the object-in-context task.
